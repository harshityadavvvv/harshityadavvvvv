    <hr><h2><u><em>Mona Lisa</em></u></h2>
    <p>The Mona Lisa is a renowned Renaissance painting by Leonardo da Vinci, believed to be Lisa del Giocondo, a Florentine merchant's wife.<br> It's a half-length portrait known for its revolutionary artistic techniques, such as the sfumato style, and features an enigmatic smile that has captivated viewers for centuries. The painting is housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris and remains one of the world's most famous and celebrated works of art. </br> </p>

    <h2><u><em>Girl with a Pearl Earring by Johannes Vermeer (1665)</em></u></h2>
    <p>Girl with a Pearl Earring by Dutch artist Jan Vermeer is often referred to as the northern Mona Lisa.<br> This is not only because of its extraordinary popularity, but also because the expression on the girl's face is difficult to capture and explain. Very little is known about the painting: it is not dated, the name of the girl depicted is unknown. In 2003, based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, a film was cut about the hypothetical creation of the painting.</br></p>

    <h2><u><em>The Night Watch by Rembrandt van Rijn (1642)</em></u></h2>
    <p>The true name of this painting by Rembrandt is The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch.<br> In the 19th century, art critics who discovered the painting thought that human figures were standing against a dark background, and it was called The Night Watch. Later it was discovered that a layer of soot made the painting dark, though the action actually takes place during the day. However, the painting replenished the treasury of famous art pieces under the name The Night Watch. The painting is kept in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.</br></p>
